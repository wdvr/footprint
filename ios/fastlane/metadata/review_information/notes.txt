This app allows users to track countries, US states, and Canadian provinces they have visited on an interactive map.

No login is required to use the app - users can optionally sign in with Apple to sync data across devices.

To test:
1. Launch the app
2. Tap on countries on the map to mark them as visited
3. View statistics in the Stats tab
4. Explore the Countries list view

The app works fully offline and requires no special credentials for review.
