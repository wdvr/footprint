            solely for providing the service.
          </p>

            privacy policies.

            OR SECURE.
          </p>

          <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <p>
            TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,

            the App or by other means. Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes
            acceptance of the modified Terms.
          </p>

          <h2>11. Termination</h2>
          <p>
            We may terminate or suspend your access to the App at any time, without prior notice,
