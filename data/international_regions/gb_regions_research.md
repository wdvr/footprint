# United Kingdom Administrative Divisions - ISO 3166-2:GB

## Overview

The United Kingdom has a complex administrative structure with multiple levels of division. For travel tracking purposes, there are several options:
1. **Four Nations** (England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland) - simplest
2. **Ceremonial Counties** (48 in England + nations) - traditional/geographic
3. **Administrative Subdivisions** (150+ areas) - full local government detail

**Code Note:** Though GB is the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code, UK is exceptionally reserved for the United Kingdom. GB is used for ISO 3166-2 codes.
